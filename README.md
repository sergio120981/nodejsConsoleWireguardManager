<h1>CLI app in Node to manage wireguard connections</h1>

This little CLI app allows:
 - manage the main data config about wireguard Interface 
 - manage Peers for each wireguard file (for each Interface)
 - export User configuration
 - export wgX.conf file to destination & reload service

That's all
